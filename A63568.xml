            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The next was <hi>Benjamin Pennery,</hi> a notorious High-way-man, having for a long time followed thoſe unlawful Enterpriſes, at laſt intangled in the Snares of Juſtice, was juſtly brought to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his Crimes, for he in the Company of three more ſetting upon a Coach upon <hi>Bagſhot-Heath,</hi> in <hi>Bark-ſhire,</hi> wherein was one Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> and three or four Gentlewomen, at their firſt coming up they fired into the Coach, and ſhot the ſaid Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain through the Arm, after rifling him and his Company, yet got no greater Booty, than two or three half-ſhirts, ſome other neceſſary Linnen; a Piſtol, and forty Shillings in mony, the Shirts and Piſtol being ſometime after offered by <hi>Penneries</hi> wife to Sail, were known, and ſhe apprehended, who bringing out her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he alledged he had them of one <hi>French,</hi> who was hang'd the laſt Seſſions, but there being farther Teſtimony given againſt him, by one <hi>Hix,</hi> that had been formerly of the ſame Gang, that he had been in his Company in ſeveral Robberies, at the Robbing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101501:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->ſeveral Carriers near <hi>Barnet</hi> of ſeveral parcels of goods and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and whas was more, that they once cheated him of his Snack and therefore left their Company, and had ſince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached many of the Gang, for theſe Enormities, he received Sentence of Death, his Behaviour was reſolute, little regarding the Admonitions of the Court as to a Preparation to Eternity, nor yet in Priſon, to ſuch as gave him good Inſtructions; But when the fatal moment was at hand, that he unavoidably muſt appear before the dreadful Throne of an Almighty Judg to Anſwer for his Actions here below, his Conſcience was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he declared a hearty ſorrow for his Sins, caſting up his Eyes and Hands to Heaven and uttering many admoniſhing words, unto the multitude, ſo continuing till he changed for Immortallity.</p>
            <p>The next were thoſe notorious cruel Companions in Iniquity, <hi>viz. John Dell</hi> of <hi>Edger,</hi> and <hi>Richard Dean,</hi> they having no leſs than three Indictments laid againſt them, the firſt for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Dells</hi> Wife, the ſecond for murdering <hi>Daniel Ball</hi> his Father in Law, the third for ſtealing a Mare, but by reaſon there could be nothing proved poſitively againſt them on the two firſt, they were brought in not Guilty. But to ſee how juſt Heaven is, notwithſtanding they had eſcaped for committing thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous crimes, yet both he and his confederate were Condemned for ſtealing a Mare, ſold by <hi>Dean,</hi> and juſtified by <hi>Dell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the fatal ſound of Death had made Impreſſion on their Souls, and their Conſciences awakened from the drowſie Lether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy or ſeared hardneſs that the many dreadful Crimes by them committed had inured them to, and they began to gaze upon a vaſt Eternity and inward feelings of the mighty Guilts, ſeeing themſelves plunged into the depth of Miſery, began moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to Repent; they being kept aſſunder that they might the better unburthen their Cenſciences, to thoſe Miniſters that came to exhort them for the good of their immortal Souls, they both ſhewed abundance of ſorrow and contrition for the manifold and grievous Sins they had committed, <hi>Dell</hi> declaring that his crying Sins had provoked the Almighty God to give him over to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore he had run into ſuch diſtructive ways, for that he had for the moſt part defrauded or cheated whomſoever he had any thing to do withal, the Miniſter deſired him to confeſs if he were conſcious of the horrid Murders he ſtood charged withal, to which he anſwered very doubtfully, ſaying he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and grievous Sins, which like lead preſſed down his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101501:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 21 -->Soul, and ſtopping there let fall ſome Tears, deſiring all to Pray for mercy to his Soul, and farther, that he hoped God would not lay to his Charge the Cruelty he uſed towards his Wife, and in a dubious manner did confeſs the Crime. <hi>Dean</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was exceeding penitent, ſaying that <hi>Dell</hi> had brought him to this ſhameful End, ſo they continued at the place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſiring the Great God of Heaven and Earth, to pardon their great Offences, and that all would take warning by their fatal Ends.</p>
            <p>The next was <hi>Francis Adkins,</hi> a notorious Pickpocket, who was commonly uſed to commit that villanous Act in Churches, and other publick reſorts, and when he obſerved the People did not Watch as well as Pray, he would be ſure to dive into their Pockets; But having picked the Pocket of one Mr; <hi>Stephens</hi> of about eight or nine ſhillings in <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> but he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ere he could diſpoſe of the monies, and ſeveral remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pieces found about him, at the ſame time another having his pocket picked of ſix or ſeven ſhillings, who coming in where he found ſome of his monies likewiſe, ſo that in Court it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he had been in <hi>Newgate</hi> ſeveral times, and an old offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was found Guilty, and received Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>During the reſpit for preparing himſelf for another World he greatly bewailed his miſ-ſpent time, and deſired the Charitable Prayers of all good Chriſtians, and exhorted all to a timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to deſire the Mercy of a never failing God before they came to ſtand upon the Brink of Eternity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next were <hi>Suſanna White,</hi> and <hi>Deborah Rogers,</hi> for ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Silver Tankard from one <hi>Mr. Sparkle</hi> of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, the former had been a notorious Shoplift, and was thought to bring the latter into this preminire, the Tankard was found in her Basket, the Fellony was plain, and they received Sentence, after which, they infinitely bewailed themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Mercy from above, and Pardon for all their Sins, and ſo they all departed this Life, to Anſwer for their particular Offences, before the Tribunal of the great God.</p>
